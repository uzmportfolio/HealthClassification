# HealthClassification
Healthy vs unhealthy patients

A comparison of various machine learning algorithms, to find which algorithm works best to clasify whether a patient is likely to be healthy or unhealthy as they age. 

Machine Learning Algortithms used:

Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM, K-Nearest-Neighbours, LDA, RandomForestClassifier, Naive Bayes.

Steps taken:

1. Data exploration.

Understanding the dataset and what it is telling us.

2. Cleaning the Dataset.

Steps include:
  Renaming columns, dealing with duplicates, filling missing values

3. Visual Analysis of data

How is the data skewed? 
Patterns amongst the variables/features

4. Training and Testing the models
5. Evaluating the results
